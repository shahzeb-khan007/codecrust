      //the events that i am trying to trigger are simply like a bubble like water in a bubble
      ///once the event reaches the target element it starts moving to the root element from the inner
// at this point of time when we see events moving this is called as bubbling phase
///when an event is triggered it moves to two phases one is capturing the events start at root of the dom and works its way to the target element where from the element was triggered
 ///target element to root element is called bubbling  
 //from the root to the target is called capturing
 //and we can stop it anywhere on that element  by using event.stop propagation()
